Things to do:


Done:
- fixed issues in CLientTransaction caused due to change in Service Sale Record schema
- add elements in navbar
- make clientTransactions the default in transactions
- added icons to sale record page.
- fix params issue in sales record page
- add payment cleared parameter to sale record page
- added show all employees functionality in employees page
- fix form overlapping navbar by changing h-screen to min-h-screen so that if the forms or anything else exceeds the screen height, it doesn't overlap with navbar
- seperated Client Transactions and Operational Expenses route form and table logic into seperate components
- create an All transaction page


Improvements:
Services:
1. save search parameters when going from "/services" to "/services/$id"
2. Disable buttons while form is submitting
3. Figure out how to provide data to refine function messages in zod


Update logic:
- users/:id page => Can only update userName, fname, lname. User clearance must be higher or equal to owner
- profile page => Can update password too.
Owner can update manager and worker information and also disbale their accounts.
Admin can update every role information or disbale account.


Create a seperate route for updating password. 
    - ask for old password
    - ask for new password


Forms overlapping with navbar:
- update employee



 const fetchFormValues = (formData: FormData) => {
    const start_date: string = (formData.get("start_date") as string) || "";
    const end_date: string = (formData.get("end_date") as string) || "";
    const mobile_num: string = (formData.get("mobile_num") as string) || "";
    const payment_options = payment_option_ref.current?.map((opt) => opt.value);

    if (start_date || end_date || mobile_num || payment_options.length > 0) {
      return {
        start_date,
        end_date,
        payment_options,
        mobile_num,
      };
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  };
