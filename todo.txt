Next:
add superrefine to validation of  clientTransaction
integrate form into product sale update


Fixes:
Check product, include price while creating


change schema to create a deals and service record joining table
it will have deal_id, record_id and quantity
also added created_at field in multiple models
create a seed file

refactor sale record create Part2
merge deals and services into one
fetch them using getAll(get rid of references)
add render functionality to it(like employees, look productsSaleRecord for more recent version)
modify formData, how it is saved, how it is retrieved.




Improvements:
Services:
1. save search parameters when going from "/services" to "/services/$id"
2. Disable buttons while form is submitting
3. Figure out how to provide data to refine function messages in zod
