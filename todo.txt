Things to do:
- create an All transaction page



Done:
- fixed issues in CLientTransaction caused due to change in Service Sale Record schema
- add elements in navbar
- make clientTransactions the default in transactions

Improvements:
Services:
1. save search parameters when going from "/services" to "/services/$id"
2. Disable buttons while form is submitting
3. Figure out how to provide data to refine function messages in zod


Update logic:
- users/:id page => Can only update userName, fname, lname. User clearance must be higher or equal to owner
- profile page => Can update password too.
Owner can update manager and worker information and also disbale their accounts.
Admin can update every role information or disbale account.


Create a seperate route for updating password. 
    - ask for old password
    - ask for new password
